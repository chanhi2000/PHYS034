Suppose that you seal an ordinary $$60\:W$$ lightbulb and a suitable battery inside a transparent enclosure and suspend the system from a very sensitive balance. 
1. Compute the change in the mass of the system if the lamp is on continuously for one year at full power. 
2. What difference, if any, would it make if the inner surface of the container were a perfect reflector?
