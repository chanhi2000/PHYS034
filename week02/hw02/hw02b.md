## 1.47(a-d)
Two spaceships, each $$100\:\text{m}$$ long when measured at rest, travel toward each other with speeds of $$0.85c$$ relative to Earth. 
1. How long is each ship as measured by someone on Earth? 
2. How fast is each ship traveling as measured by an observer on the other? 
3. How long is one ship when measured by an observer on the other? 
4. At time $$t=0$$ on Earth, the fronts of the ships are together as they just begin to pass each other.  At what time on Earth are their ends together?
