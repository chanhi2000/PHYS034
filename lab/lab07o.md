## TITLE:
NUCLEAR SAFETY PRIMER (2014)

## INTROUDCTION:
Every day, you are exposed to nuclear radiation (and other sources of potentially damaging radiation). Bananas contain (radioactive)potassium $$^{40}\text{K}$$. Most smoke detectors contain (radioactive) $$^{241}\text{Am}$$. Concrete used to construct buildings typically contains small amounts of (radioactive) $$^{226}\text{Ra}$$, $$^{232}\text{Th}$$, and $$^{40}\text{K}$$. Even flying on an airplane increases your exposure to charged-particles and gamma rays because at high altitude less of the Earth's atmosphere is available to shield you.  In your physics lab this week, you will use localized radioactieve sources of known isotope, activity $$(\tfrac{\text{counts}}{\text{s}})$$, emission type (*e.g.*, alpha, beta, gamma, or neutron), emission energy (typically nuclear decay energies are between $$\sim100\:\text{keV}$$ and $$5\:\text{MeV}$$), and half-life (the time it takes for the source emission rate to drop by $$50\:%$$). Your instructor also will teach you about the four basic types of nuclear radiation and the basic physics related to those decays. The radioactive sources you will use in this lab are not harmful if used properly.  After you have read the safety information below your lab instructor will review for you the safety protocols you must follow when working with radioactive sources.  Be sure to ask questions if you have them before starting any experiments.

## NUCLEAR RADIATION
There are four main types of nuclear decay products: alpha particles, beta particles, gamma-rays, and neutrons. To be safe around nuclear sources, always keep your exposure "**A**s **L**ow **A**s **R**easonably **A**chievable" (**ALARA**). Before doing any experiment with any radioactive source, you should know the types of radiation your source emits, the energy of the emitted radiation, the activity of the source as measured in Curies, and the best way to use the source safely for your application. Remember to consider your lab partners and neighbors as much as yourself when establishing a safe working area.


## SAFETY IN THE LAB
How much damage any one radiation event can cause depends on the type of radiation (alpha, beta, gamma, neutron), its energy, and the type of material hit. For example, alpha particles and neutrons do $$\sim20$$ times more damage than gamma rays of the same energy. Your instructor will summarize the basic physics behind why this is so and will also explain the different stopping mechanism for alphas, betas, gammas, and neutrons. You will also be instructed how to best protect yourself (and others) while working with radiation sources in the lab. The focus of that important discussion will be threefold:
- #### Minimize the **TIME** you spend near radiation sources
- #### Maximize the **DISTANCE** between you and the source.[^1]


- #### Use appropriate **SHIELDING** when near radiation sources

## USEFUL DEFINITION
1. Curie $$[\text{Ci}]$$: $$3.7\times10^{10}\:\tfrac{\text{decays}}{\text{s}}$$. Most lab sources are $$\sim10^{6}$$-$$10^{3}\:\text{Ci}$$ (still a lot of activity!)

2. Half-life ($$\tau_{1/2}$$): amount of time it takes for half of that sample to decay. Some radioisotopes have long half-lives and some have short half-lives: $$^{14}\text{C}$$ takes $$5,730\:\text{yr}$$ for any given quantity to decay to half of the original amount of radio activity. $$^{32}\text{P}$$ has a two week half-life. $$^{8}\text{Li}$$ decays by $$50\:\%$$ in $$<1\:\text{sec}$$.

3. $$\text{Rad}$$ (**R**adiation **a**bsorbed **d**ose): $$100$$ ergs of energy deposition per gram of absorber.

4. $$\text{Rem}$$ (**R**adiation **e**quivalent **man**): does equivalent that takes into account the biological effectiveness of different types of radiation.

5. $$\text{Gray}=100\:\text{Rad}$$

6. $$\text{Sievert}=100\:\text{Rem}$$

7. $$\text{Becquerel}=1\:\tfrac{\text{decays}}{\text{s}}$$
