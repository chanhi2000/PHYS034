Einstein used trains for a number of relativity thought experiments since they were the fastest objects commonly recognized in those days.  Letâ€™s consider a train moving at $$0.65c$$ along a straight track at night.  Its headlight produces a beam with an angular spread of $$60^{\circ}$$ according to the engineer.  If you are standing alongside the track (rails are $$1.5\:\text{m}$$ apart), how far from you is the train when you see its approaching headlight suddenly disappear?
