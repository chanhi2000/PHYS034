## 1.44
A burst of $$p+$$ mesons (pions) travels down an evacuated beam tube at Fermilab moving at $$\beta=0.92$$ with respect to the laboratory.  
1. Compute $$\gamma$$ for this group of pions.
2. The proper mean lifetime of pions is $$2.6\times10^{-8}\:\text{s}$$.  What mean lifetime is measured in the lab?  
3. If the burst contained 50,000 pions, how many remain after the group has traveled $$50\:\text{m}$$ down the beam tube?  
4. What would be the answer to (3) ignoring time dilation?
