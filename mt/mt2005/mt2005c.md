On June 30, 1908 residents in and near the Tunguska River Valley in Siberia observed a brilliant flash in the sky followed by an earthquake. It is now widely accepted that this event, which uprooted trees over a radius of $$30$$ to $$40\:\text{km}$$, was caused by the explosion in the atmosphere of a stony “impactor” of radius approximately $$R=40\:\text{m}$$. Viewed from $$100\:\text{km}$$ away, the flash was estimated to have been more than 100 times brighter than the sun, that is, the power flux was about $$2\times10^5\:\text{W}/\text{m}^2$$.

**(a)** Assume that the kinetic energy of this impactor was released in a time span of 7 seconds. What total energy (in $$\text{J}$$) was released?

**(b)** Assume that the impactor radiated like a blackbody at the instant of the explosion. Use the data above to find the approximate surface temperature (in $$\text{K}$$) of the impactor at that moment.
