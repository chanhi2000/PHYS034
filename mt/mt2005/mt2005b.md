Photons and such...

**(a)** What is the wavelength (in $$\unicode{xC5}$$) of a photon of energy $$E=2\:\text{eV}$$?

**(b)** A photon of energy $$E=3\:\text{MeV}$$ undergoes pair production, which results in the creation of an electron and a positron. What kinetic energy (in $$\text{eV}$$) does the electron and positron each acquire? Assume the decay is symmetric.

**(c)** A photon of wavelength $$\lambda=0.06\:\unicode{xC5}$$ Compton scatters off a quasi-free electron in a metal. If the photon is observed to be scattered at angle $$\theta=30^{\circ}$$ from the original photon direction, what is the wavelength (in $$\unicode{xC5}$$) of the scattered photon?

**(d)** A photon of wavelength $$\lambda=0.06\:\unicode{xC5}$$ Compton scatters off a quasi-free electron in a metal. If the wavelength of the scattered photon is $$\lambda'=0.09\:\unicode{xC5}$$, what is the kinetic energy (in $$\text{eV}$$) of the electron after the scatter takes place?

**(e)** In class I got slightly stuck working out a number for the Rydberg energy
$$E_0=\frac{m_e(ke^2)^2}{2\hbar^2}$$. You might recall my problem was remembering to convert from Joules to eV. But I would normally never do this computation in SI units – too complicated! Better to use “particle physicist” numbers, like on the first page of this test. Use those numbers to find a value (in $$\text{eV}$$) for the Rydberg energy. You may have to use some constants to determine the value of other constants that are needed.
