At the Galactic Olympics, all competitors are required to move at close to light speed. A pole vaulter picks up a pole of length $$L=5\:\text{m}$$ and then races down the $$100\:\text{m}$$ runway towards the vaulting pit. Stationary spectators in the stands measure her velocity to be $$v_{\text{PV}}=0.8c$$. She holds the out in front of her, that is, aligned with her direction of motion.

**(a)** How long (in meters) does the pole appear to the pole vaulter as she runs down the runway?

**(b)** How long (in meters) does the pole appear to the stationary spectators as she runs by?

**(c)** How long (in seconds) does her run take as she measures it?

**(d)** How long (in seconds) does her run take when measured by the stationary spectators?

**(e)** As the pole vaulter travels down the runway, a sprinter runs past her in the opposite
direction. The stationary spectators measure his velocity to be $$v_s=0.65c$$. How fast is he moving as measured by the pole vaulter?
