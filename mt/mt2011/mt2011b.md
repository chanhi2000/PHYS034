Some decay processes...
**(a)** What is the wavelength (in $$\text{nm}$$) of a photon that can pair produce a positron-electron pair ($$\gamma\to{e}^+e^-$$) each with 50 keV of kinetic energy?

**(b)** A particle known as the $$\text{J}/\Psi$$ can decay to pair of charged muons ($$\text{J}/\Psi\to\mu^+mu^-$$). In the rest frame of the $$\text{J}/\Psi$$ the decay is symmetric; what is the kinetic energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of each muon?

**(c)** A particle known as the $$\text{J}/\Psi$$ can decay to pair of charged muons ($$\text{J}/\Psi\to\mu^+mu^-$$). In the rest frame of the $$\text{J}/\Psi$$ the decay is symmetric; what is the speed (in terms of $$c$$) of each muon?
