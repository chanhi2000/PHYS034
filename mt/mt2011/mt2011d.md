##4.
The Sun radiates like a blackbody, with surface temperature of $$5800\:\text{K}$$. The mass of the Sun is $$2\times10^{30}\:\text{kg}$$, and the radius of the Sun is $$7\times10^8\:\text{m}$$.

**(a)** Find the Sun’s total power output (in $$\text{W}$$).

**(b)** Assuming the rate at which the Sun radiates is constant, how long will it take (in years) for the Sun to disappear?

**(c)** In one step in the fusion process by which energy is released in the Sun, two protons fuse together to form a deuteron. In this process a positron and a neutrino are created ($$p+p\to{d}+e^++v_e$$). About how much energy (in $$MeV$$) is released in this process? Treat the neutrino as massless. (“About” because the real process is not quite as described here.)
