##3.
A 0.1 W isotropic light source emits photons of wavelength $$\lambda=490\:\text{nm}$$. Light from this bulb falls on a Lithium target, which has a work function $$\phi_0=2.3\:\text{eV}$$

**(a)** The human eye responds to light if more than 60 photons per second enter the pupil. What is the maximum distance (in $$\text{km}$$) at which this light source would be observable, assuming no light is absorbed between the bulb and the person? In the dark the pupil is typically open to a radius of $$6\:\text{mm}$$.

**(b)** Find the frequency (in $$\text{Hz}$$) of the light.

**(c)** What is the maximum kinetic energy (in $$\text{eV}$$) of an electron liberated from the Lithium target?
