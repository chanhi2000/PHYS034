## 1.
The Interplanetary Hyperloop is a long, straight trube that connects a point on Earth's orbit with a point out beyond Pluto's orbit.  The proper length of the Interplanetary Hyperloop is $$6.000\times10^{12}\:\text{m}$$. Passenger cars, which have a proper length of $$1234\:\text{m}$$, travel in both directions through the Interstellar Hyperloop.  **NOTE**: all answers should be a number with appropriate units.

**(a)** A supervisor in the control tower (that is fixed to the Interstellar Hyperloop tube halfway between its ends) observes a passenger car approaching at $$0.8000c$$.. What length does she measure the car to be?

**(b)** The supervisor measures the speed of the passenger car to be a constant $$0.8000c$$ for the entire end-to-end trip.  According to a clock on the wall of the control tower, how long (in time) does it take for the passenger car to make the trip?  Ignore initial acceleration and final deceleration.

**(c)** How long (in time) does the end-to-end trip take as measured by a passenger onboard the passenger car?  Ignore initial acceleration and final deceleration.

**(d)** Two passenger cars approach each other, each travelling at $$0.2468c$$ as measured by the supervisor in the control tower.  What length does someone in one of the cars measure as the length of the other car?

######**(a)** A supervisor in the control tower (that is fixed to the Interstellar Hyperloop tube halfway between its ends) observes a passenger car approaching at $$0.8000c$$.. What length does she measure the car to be?

\begin{align*}
