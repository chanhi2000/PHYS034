##2.
An antiproton ($$\bar{p}$$), which has the same mass as a proton, can be created by smashing two protons together. Two protons collide head-on, each traveling at speed $$v$$. Find the minimum value of $$v$$ that can result in the creation of an antiproton by the reaction $$p+p\to{p}+p+p+\bar{p}$$ .
