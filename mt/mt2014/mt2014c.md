##3.
Engineers use a new material to create a small sphere that radiates as a perfect blackbody. The sphere has a radius of $$0.0354\:\text{cm}$$ and a mass of $$0.247\:\text{kg}$$. When the sphere is heated so that it glows, engineers measure an intensity of $$488\:\text{W}/\text{m}^2$$ at a distance of $$3\:\text{m}$$ from the center of the sphere.

**(a)** Find the surface temperature (in K) of the sphere.

**(b)** If there sphere were kept at the temperature you found in part (a), how long (in years) would it
take for the sphere to completely evaporate through radiation?
