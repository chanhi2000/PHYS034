The Betazoids, members of the United Federation of Planets, have developed the r’tH, a new, fast space craft. The proper length of the r’tH is $$428\:\text{m}$$. The r’tH zooms past Earth at a speed of $$0.6c$$ (measured by you, on Earth). Deanna Troi, the most well-known Betazoid, is aboard the r’tH.

**(a), (b)** How long (in m) does the r’tH appear to (a)
Deanna Troi? (b) you?


**(c), (d)** How long (in s) does it take for an accurate
clock on the r’tH to tick off 10 seconds, as
observed by (c) Deanna Troi? (d) you? (You look through a telescope to see the clock.)

**(e), (f)** As it zooms past Earth, the r’tH fires a laser so that a beam of light is emitted straight out from the front of the ship. How fast does the laser light travel, as observed by (e) Deanna Troi? (f) you? A good guess without proof is acceptable for part (e), but full credit for part (f) requires proof using the Lorentz contraction.

**(g)** As it flies past Earth, the r’tH releases a drone that travels at 0.2c relative to the ship. Deanna Troi sees the drone leave the ship at an angle of 90o from the direction that the r’tH is moving. What is the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the drone as measured by you?
