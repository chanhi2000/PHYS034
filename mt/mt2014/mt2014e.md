The work function of cesium is $$2.10\:\text{eV}$$.

**(a)** What is the smallest wavelength of a photon that can liberate a photoelectron from a
cesium surface?

**(b)**  What is the kinetic energy of a photoelectron liberated from a cesium surface when
struck by the photon described in part (a)?

**(c)** If a 1000-eV photon creates a photoelectron in a cesium surface, what is the maximum speed that
the electron can be traveling after it leaves the surface?
