**(a)** A positron has kinetic energy $$K=20\:\text{MeV}$$. Find its total energy and momentum.

**(b)** An electron has total energy $$E=2\:\text{MeV}$$. Find its velocity as a fraction of $$c$$.

**(c)** A photon has energy $$E_\gamma=4\:\text{eV}$$. Find its wavelength in Angstroms. Also, is it in the visible?

**(d)** A neutral $$D^0$$ particle can decay into a two charged Kaons, that is, $$D^0\to{K^+}K^-$$. In the rest
frame of the $$D^0$$, what is the kinetic energy of each of the Kaons? A D0 has rest mass $$1864\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$, and charged Kaons have rest mass $$494\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$.
