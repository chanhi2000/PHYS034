A certain star has a surface temperature of $$T=5700\:\text{K}$$ and a radius of $$R=7\times10^8\:\text{m}$$. Photons emitted from the star have a mean wavelength $$\lambda_{\gamma}=5700\:\unicode{xC5}$$ Angstroms. An observing station orbits the star at a distance of $$D=1.5\times10^{11}\:\text{m}$$.

**(a)** Find the total power radiated by this star.

**(b)** When an observer on the station looks at the star, how many photons per second enter his eye? Assume that this observerâ€™s pupil (opening to the eye) has a radius of $$R_p=1\:\text{mm}$$.

**(c)** It is observed that when light from the star strikes a certain metal target, electrons are emitted in a process that we call the photoelectric effect. The most energetic of these electrons carry kinetic energy $$K_e=5.2\:\text{eV}$$. Find the work function of this metal.
