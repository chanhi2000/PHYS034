##2.
A precision clock and a small laser are attached to a straight rod of length $$L=20\:\text{m}$$ on earth then shot out into space at velocity $$v=0.9c$$. It is observed by a scientist on the space station as it passes by and heads off to parts unknown.

**(a)** What does the observer measure as the length of the rod?

**(b)** The observerâ€™s clock ticks off 10 seconds during the time she watches the rod. How long a time interval does the clock attached to the rod show during her 10 seconds?

**(c)** As the rod is approaching the space station the laser is fired. What velocity (in terms of $$c$$) does the observer measure for the speed of the laser light?

**(d)** The clock and laser are connected so that when the clock reads that exactly 100 seconds have elapsed since the laser physically passed the station, it fires a laser pulse back towards the observer. How long after the laser passes the observer does she see the pulse?
