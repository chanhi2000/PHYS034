##1.
The Starship Enterprise zooms past Earth. You measure its speed as $$0.13c$$. Through the window on the engineering deck you can see (with really good binoculars) the 13-meter-long ladder that Scotty uses to change the light bulb above the warp core. (**NOTE**: all answers are numbers.)

**(a)** The ladder is lying flat on the floor. How long do you measure it to be?

**(b)** You see Hans Solo piloting the Millennium Falcon directly toward the Enterprise, also at a
speed of $$0.13c$$ relative to you. What does Hans Solo measure as the length of the ladder?

**(c)** Scotty tilts the ladder against a wall in order to change the bulb. Before walking under it (not
today, Scotty!) he notices that the ladder makes an angle of $$30^{\circ}$$ with respect to the floor. At what angle with respect to the floor do you see the ladder?
