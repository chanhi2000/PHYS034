A neutral $$B$$ meson can decay to two charged D mesons ($$B^0\to{D}^+D^-$$), and also to a neutral $$D$$ together with a photon ($$B^0\to{D}^0\gamma$$). The masses of these particles are (approximately): $$B^0-5280\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$; $$D^+/D^--1862\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$; $$D^0-1865\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$. (**NOTE**: all answers are numbers.)

**(a)** A $$B^0$$ zips through the lab at a speed of $$0.55c$$. Find the total energy of the $$B^0$$ as measured in the rest frame of the $$B^0$$.

**(b)** A $$B^0$$ zips through the lab at a speed of $$0.55c$$, then $$B^0\to{D}^+D^-$$: Call the direction in which the $$B^0$$ is traveling the positive $$x$$-direction. In the rest frame of the $$B^0$$, the $$D^+$$ goes in the positive $$x$$ direction and the $$D^-$$ goes in the negative $$x$$ direction. Find the speed and direction of the $$D^-$$ particle as measured in the lab frame.

**(c)** $$B^0\to{D}^0\gamma$$: Find the speed of the $$D^0$$ in the rest frame of the $$B^0$$.
