##3.
A 35-W monochromatic light bulb emits photons uniformly in all directions. The bulb is placed a $$4\:\text{m}$$ from a gold target the presents a cross-sectional area $$2\:\text{cm}$$ by $$3\:\text{cm}$$ to the light. The energy of the light is just sufficient to liberate electrons from the gold via the photoelectric effect. The work function of gold is $$\phi_0=5.10\:\text{eV}$$.

**(a)** Is the light from this bulb visible to humans? Justify your answer.

**(b)** Find the number of photons per second radiated by the bulb.

**(c)** Find the photoelectric current arising in the target, assuming the gold surface is clean and there are many electrons as necessary right at the surface. Express your answer in electrons per second.

**(d)** If the energy of the radiated photons is increased, but all other aspects of this setup remain the same, will the photoelectric current increase, decrease, or stay the same? Justify your answer.
