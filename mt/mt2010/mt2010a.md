A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, little Luke Skywalker slides down the Colossal Slide at the Galactic Amusement park. The engineers who built the Colossal Slide measured it to straight and $$9\times10^6\:\text{m}$$ long. The drag on Luke as he slides results in a constant velocity of $$0.8c$$ as observed by his Aunt Beru watching from a nearby bench, which is at rest with respect to the Colossal Slide.

**(a)** How long (in $$\text{m}$$) does the Colossal Slide appear to Luke as he slides down?

**(b)** How long (in $$\text{m}$$) does the Colossal Slide appear to Aunt Beru?

**(c)** How long (in $$\text{s}$$) does it take for Luke to slide down, as observed by Luke?

**(d)** How long (in $$\text{s}$$) does it take for Luke to slide down, as observed by Aunt Beru?

**(e)** Aunt Beru can see Luke’s wristwatch, which has a hand that reads out in milliseconds, as he slides by. How long does (in $$\text{ms}$$) does it take for Luke’s watch to tick $$1\:\text{ms}$$, as observed by Aunt Beru?

**(f)** As he slides down, Luke fires his laser pointer (he’s too young for a light saber) straight forward. Use the Lorentz contraction to find the speed (in terms of $$c$$) of the laser beam as observed by Aunt Beru.
