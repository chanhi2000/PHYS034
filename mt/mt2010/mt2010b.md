##2.
A neutral Î· particle can decay into a pair of charged muons: $$\eta\to\mu^+\mu^-$$. Take the rest mass of the $$\eta$$ as $$548\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$ and the rest mass of the muons as $$106\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$.

**(a)** Consider an $$\eta$$ carrying $$300\:\text{MeV}$$ of kinetic energy $$\eta$$ which decays as shown to the right. Find the angle $$\theta$$ at which the two muons leave the decay.

**(b)** Consider the decay of an $$\eta$$ in which the muons go off in exactly opposite directions with exactly the same kinetic energy when viewed in the rest frame of the $$\eta$$. (**NOTE**: The drawing above is NOT this case!) Find the kinetic energy of each muon as viewed in the rest frame of the $$\eta$$.

**(c)** For the decay described in part (b), find the velocity of each of muon as viewed in the rest frame of the $$\eta$$. Give your answer as a number times the speed of light.
