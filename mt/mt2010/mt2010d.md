##4.
A photon of wavelength $$\lambda=0.002\:\text{nm}$$ Compton scatters off an electron at rest. The scattered electron is observed to leave the interaction with $$0.3\:\text{MeV}. **NOTE**: the picture is not intended to accurately represent the angles at which the photon and electron leave the interaction point.

**(a)** Find the energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of the scattered photon.

**(b)** Find the angle $$\theta$$ at which the scattered photon leaves the interaction.
