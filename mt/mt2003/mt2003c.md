##3.
The first three spectral series of Hydrogen are the Lyman, Balmer, and Paschen series respectively. The lines in the Lyman series range from about 950 to 1200 Angstroms ($$\unicode{xC5}$$). The lines in the Paschen series range from about $$10,000$$ to $$18,750\:\unicode{xC5}$$. The wavelengths in any series can be determined from the Rydberg equation
$$
	\frac{1}{\lambda}=R_H\left(\frac{1}{n^2}-\frac{1}{m^2}\right)
$$
where $$R_H=1.09737\times10^7\:m^{-1}$$ and $$m>n$$.

**(a)** What is the longest wavelength in the Balmer series? State your answer in Angstroms.

**(b)** What is the energy of the shortest wavelength in the Balmer series? State your answer in $$\text{eV}$$.

**(c)** Suggest a reason that the Balmer series was discovered long before the other two.
