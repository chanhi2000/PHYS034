A number of electrons move down an accelerator line in a long, thin bunch. An observer in the laboratory measures these electrons to have a relativistic $$\gamma=7$$, and measures the length of the bunch to be $$L=1\:\text{m}$$.

**(a)** What is the velocity of these electrons? State your answer in terms of $$c$$.

**(b)** What is the proper length of the bunch, that is, the length as measured in a frame at rest with respect to the electrons?

**(c)** What is the kinetic energy of these electrons?

**(d)** The accelerator parameters are changed so the electrons now move at $$v=0.8c$$. The bunch of
electrons is still measured to have length $$L=1\:\text{m}$$ in the lab. A second identical bunch of electrons is sent in the opposite direction up the accelerator line. How long is the first bunch of electrons as measured in a frame at rest with respect to second bunch?
