##4.
A spherical $$100\:\text{W}$$ light bulb has a radius $$R=5\:\text{cm}$$. Assume that its surface radiates
isotropically like a blackbody.

**(a)** Find the surface temperature of the bulb.

**(b)** Comment on how hot your part (a) answer is, by comparing it to, say, the freezing or boiling point of water.

**(c)** Assuming all photons emitted have an energy of $$3\:\text{eV}$$, find the number of photons per second
that strike a $$50\:\text{cm}^2$$ hand placed a distance $$5\:\text{m}$$ from the center ofas an area $$A=50\:\text{cm}^2$$, and place it so that its surface is uniformly $$5\:\text{cm}$$ from the bulb. Find the temperature of the surface of your hand given the assumption that it absorbs and emits like a blackbody.
