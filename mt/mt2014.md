##1.
The Betazoids, members of the United Federation of Planets, have developed the r’tH, a new, fast space craft. The proper length of the r’tH is $$428\:\text{m}$$. The r’tH zooms past Earth at a speed of $$0.6c$$ (measured by you, on Earth). Deanna Troi, the most well-known Betazoid, is aboard the r’tH.

**(a), (b)** How long (in m) does the r’tH appear to (a) Deanna Troi? (b) you?

**(c), (d)** How long (in s) does it take for an accurate
clock on the r’tH to tick off 10 seconds, as
observed by (c) Deanna Troi? (d) you? (You look through a telescope to see the clock.)

**(e), (f)** As it zooms past Earth, the r’tH fires a laser so that a beam of light is emitted straight out from the front of the ship. How fast does the laser light travel, as observed by (e) Deanna Troi? (f) you? A good guess without proof is acceptable for part (e), but full credit for part (f) requires proof using the Lorentz contraction.

**(g)** As it flies past Earth, the r’tH releases a drone that travels at 0.2c relative to the ship. Deanna Troi sees the drone leave the ship at an angle of 90o from the direction that the r’tH is moving. What is the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the drone as measured by you?

##2.
An antiproton ($$\bar{p}$$), which has the same mass as a proton, can be created by smashing two protons together. Two protons collide head-on, each traveling at speed $$v$$. Find the minimum value of $$v$$ that can result in the creation of an antiproton by the reaction $$p+p\to{p}+p+p+\bar{p}$$ .

##3.
Engineers use a new material to create a small sphere that radiates as a perfect blackbody. The sphere has a radius of $$0.0354\:\text{cm}$$ and a mass of $$0.247\:\text{kg}$$. When the sphere is heated so that it glows, engineers measure an intensity of $$488\:\text{W}/\text{m}^2$$ at a distance of $$3\:\text{m}$$ from the center of the sphere.

**(a)** Find the surface temperature (in K) of the sphere.

**(b)** If there sphere were kept at the temperature you found in part (a), how long (in years) would it
take for the sphere to completely evaporate through radiation?

##4.
An x-ray of energy $$300\:\text{keV}$$ Compton scatters off an electron (initially at rest) and leaves the interaction at $$42^{\circ}$$ from its initial direction. Find the angle that the electron leaves the interaction.

##5.
The work function of cesium is $$2.10\:\text{eV}$$.

**(a)** What is the smallest wavelength of a photon that can liberate a photoelectron from a
cesium surface?

**(b)**  What is the kinetic energy of a photoelectron liberated from a cesium surface when
struck by the photon described in part (a)?

**(c)** If a 1000-eV photon creates a photoelectron in a cesium surface, what is the maximum speed that
the electron can be traveling after it leaves the surface?
