##1.
The Star Strider, Obi-Wan Kenobiâ€™s private racing ship, is $$200\:\text{m}$$ long (its proper length) when measured in space dock. Obi-Wan has reminders about the directions it flies, and also a racing stripe, painted on the Star Strider, as shown. He also has a precision atomic clock on the bridge (which can be seen through the window) that has a proper tick length of 1 second.

**(a)** The Star Strider flies past you in the Forward direction at velocity (relative to you) $$v=0.9c$$.
    
- **(i)** How long (in $$\text{m}$$) does the Star Strider appear to you?
- **(ii)** How long (in $$\text{m}$$) does the Star Strider appear to Obi-Wan, who is flying it?
- **(iii)** How long (in $$\text{s}$$) does one clock tick last, as you measure it?
- **(iv)** How long (in s) does one clock tick last, as Obi-Wan measures it?

**(b)** 
Obi-Wan flies past (going Forward) with relativistic  $$\gamma=3.203$$; you measure the length of the racing stripe to be $$L_{\to}=36.95\:\text{m}$$. When he is landing (going Down) at the same speed, you measure the length of the racing strip to be $$L_{\downarrow}=98.03\:\text{m}$$. Find the proper length (in \text{m}) of the racing stripe, that is, the length you would measure when the Star Strider is at rest in space dock.
