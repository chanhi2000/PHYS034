Light of wavelength $$\lambda_0$$ illuminates a surface and ejects photoelectrons of maximum kinetic energy $$2\:\text{eV}$$. When the wavelength is decreased to $$\lambda_0/2$$, the maximum photoelectron kinetic energy is observed to be $$5\:\text{eV}$$.

**(a)** What maximum kinetic energy will be observed if the wavelength of the light is decreased to $$\lambda_0/4$$?

**(b)** What wavelength of light must be used to eject photoelectrons from the surface that are traveling at $$0.002c$$?
