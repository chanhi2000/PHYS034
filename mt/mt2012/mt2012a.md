A $$\phi$$ particle is shot directly down the length of a tube that is $$10\:\text{m}$$ long as measured in our lab. We measure the speed of the $$\phi$$ to be $$0.9c$$. The $$\phi$$ decays to two kaons ($$\phi\to{K}^+K^-$$) inside the tube.

**(a)** In the rest frame of the $$\phi$$, what is the total energy of one of the kaons?

**(b)** In the rest frame of the $$\phi$$, what is the kinetic energy of one of kaons?

**(c)** In the rest frame of the $$\phi$$, what is the speed of one of the kaons?

**(d)** In the rest frame of $$\phi$$, what is the length of the tube?

**(e)** In the rest frame of $$\phi$$, how long would it take for the $$\phi$$ to travel from one of the tube to the other?

**(f)** How long would it take for the $$\phi$$ to travel from one of the tube to the other as measured by us?

**(g)** If the $$\phi$$ decays to two kaons so that one kaon is thrown directly forward in the direction of the $$\phi$$â€™s motion and the other directly backwards, how fast is the forward-going kaon traveling as measured by us?

**(h)** The $$\omega$$ particle does not decay to a $$K^+K^-$$ pair. Give a brief reason why this decay is not allowed.
