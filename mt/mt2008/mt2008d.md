A certain metal has a work function of $$\phi_0=9.0\:\text{eV}$$.

**(a)** Find the threshold wavelength (in $$\unicode{xC5}$$) of light that will produce the photoelectric effect.

**(b)** A photon of wavelength $$\lambda=1000\:\unicode{xC5}$$ strikes the metal. Find the maximum kinetic energy (in $$\text{eV}$$) of an electron ejected from the metal after absorbing this photon.
