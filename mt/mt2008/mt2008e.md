##5.
The spherical surface of a certain light bulb, of radius $$0.10\:m$$, emits like a blackbody. Photons emitted from the bulb have energy $$E_{\gamma}=2.0\:\text{eV}$$. When you hold your hand $$2\:\text{m}$$ from the center of the bulb, the intensity of the emitted energy is $$3.78\:\text{W}/\text{m}^2$$.

**(a)** Find the total power (in $$\text{W}$$) of the bulb.

**(b)** Find the surface temperature (in $$\text{K}$$) of the bulb.

**(c)** Find the number of photons per second given off by the bulb.
