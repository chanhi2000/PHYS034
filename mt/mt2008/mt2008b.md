The neutral $$\phi$$ particle can decay into two charged pions, that is, $$\phi\to\pi^+\pi^-$$. The rest mass of the $$\phi$$ is $$m_{\phi}=1020\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$ and the rest mass of the charged pion is $$m_{\phi}=140\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$.

**(a)** A $$\phi$$ particle decays as rest; the pions are produced symmetrically.
 - **(i)** Find the total energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of one of the pions.
 - **(ii)** Find the kinetic energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$)  of one of the pions.
 - **(iii)** Find the velocity (to 3 digits, in terms of $$c$$) of one of the pions.

**(b)** The $$\phi$$ particle is moving through the lab at $$v=0.7c$$ when it decays. One pion is thrown directly forward (relative to the direction of the $$\phi$$. Find the velocity (to 3 digits, in terms of $$c$$) of this pion as measured in the lab frame.
