A photon can scatter off an electron via Compton scattering...

**(a)** The Compton wavelength is given by $$\lambda_C=\frac{h}{m_e{c}}$$, where $$m_e$$ is the mass of an electron. Compute a value for $$\lambda_C$$ (in $$\unicode{xC5}$$). You can use numbers on the first page, or any others that you know.

**(b)** Is it possible to observe Compton scattering of visible light? Explain.

**(c)** A photon undergoes two successive Compton scatters, the first at $$30^{\circ}$$ and the second at $$60^{\circ}$$; the outgoing photon has wavelength $$\lambda_f=0.12\:\unicode{xC5}$$. Find the initial wavelength (in $$\unicode{xC5}$$) of the photon.
