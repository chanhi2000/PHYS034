The Klingons are shocked to observe the Galactic Rod, a rigid cylinder of proper length $$L_p=1000\:\text{m}$$, heading straight toward Qo’noS (their home planet) at a speed of $$0.8c$$. There is no relative motion between the two except along the path of the rod. To avoid a catastrophic collision the Klingons cleverly drill a hole along the 19,500-km diameter of Qo’noS, and also stop the planet from rotating; in this way, the Galactic Rod will pass harmlessly through the planet. A team of Klingon scientists are sent to ride on the Galactic Rod.

**(a)** How long (in $$\text{m}$$) does the Galactic Rod appear to the Klingon scientists sent to ride on it?

**(b)** How long (in $$\text{m}$$) does the Galactic Rod appear to Klingons on Qo’noS?

**(c)** The scientists set up a huge clock, marked off in seconds, on the Galactic Rod. How long (in $$\text{s}$$) does it take for the clock to tick once, as observed by the scientists sent to ride on it?

**(d)** How long (in $$\text{s}$$) does it take for the clock on the Galactic Rod to tick once, as observed by Klingons on Qo’noS?

**(e)** One of the scientists riding on the rod fires a laser toward Qo’noS as a signal. Find the speed (in terms of $$c$$) of this light as observed by Klingons on the planet. By “find” I mean use the Lorentz contraction – don’t just guess!

The neutral $$\omega$$ particle decays into a pair of charged pions: $$\omega\to\pi^+\pi^-$$. The rest mass of the $$\omega$$ is $$m_\omega=782\:\text{Mev}/c^2$$, and the mass of a charged pion is $$m_\pi=140\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$. The decay of a particular $$\omega$$ particle is observed in which the $$\pi^+$$ and $$\pi^-$$ each carry the same kinetic energy.

**(a)** Find the total energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of one of the pions in the rest frame of the $$\omega$$.

**(b)** Find the kinetic energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of one of the pions in the rest frame of the $$\omega$$.

**(c)**Find the velocity (to 3 digits, in terms of $$c$$) of one of the pions in the rest frame of the $$\omega$$.

**(d)** The $$\omega$$ particle is moving through the lab at $$v=0.7c$$ when it decays. The $$\pi^+$$ is thrown
directly forward relative to the direction of the $$\omega$$. Find the velocity (to 3 digits, in terms of $$c$$) of the $$\pi^+$$ as measured in the lab frame.

A 100-W bulb shines on a target made from a metal that has work function $$\phi_0=4.0\:\text{eV}$$. The frequency of the bulb is just barely sufficient to liberate electrons from the surface of the metal via the photoelectric effect.

**(a)** Find the frequency (in $$\text{Hz}$$) of the light.

**(b)** Is the light from the bulb visible to humans? Explain how you know.

**(c)** How many photons per second are emitted by the bulb?

**(d)** What is the maximum kinetic energy (in $$\text{eV}$$) of an electron liberated from the metal?

**(e)** What is the maximum kinetic energy (in $$\text{eV}$$) of an electron liberated from a Lithium target, with $$\phi_0=4.0\:\text{eV}$$, placed in front of this bulb?


##4.
A photon of wavelength $$\lambda=0.0700\:\unicode{xC5}$$ Compton scatters off an electron at rest. The scattered photon comes out of the interaction at an angle of $$\theta=48.19^{\circ}$$.

**(a)** Find the wavelength $$\lambda'$$ (in $$\unicode{xC5}$$) of the scattered photon.

**(b)** Find the kinetic energy (in $$\text{eV}$$) of the electron after the photon strikes it.

**(c)** Find the angle $$\phi$$ at which the electron leaves
the interaction.
