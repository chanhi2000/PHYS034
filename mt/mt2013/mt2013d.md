##4.
The heating filament of a 2500-W space heater is a uniform wire $$3.000\:\text{m}$$ long and $$0.0002\:\text{m}$$ in radius. (Itâ€™s wound up like a spring when in the heater.) All answers should be numbers.

**(a)** When the heater is on full blast, at what temperature (in kelvin) is the surface of the filament? Assume that the filament radiates like a blackbody.

**(b)** At $$20\:\text{m}$$ from the heater, where the filament can be treated as a point source radiating its power equally in all directions, how much energy per second (in $$\text{J}/\text{s}$$) falls on a disk of radius $$3\text{cm}$$? The disk is oriented so that the power of the heater hits it directly on its circular surface. Also, assume no energy absorption occurs between the heater and the disk.
