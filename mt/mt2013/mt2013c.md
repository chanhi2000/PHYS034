##3.
An x-ray of energy $$300\:\text{keV}$$ Compton scatters off an electron (initially at rest) and leaves the interaction with $$200\:\text{keV}$$ of energy. All answers should be numbers.

**(a)** Find the speed (in terms of c, give 4 digits after the decimal) of the electron after the
interaction.

**(b)** Find the angle, relative to the direction of the incident x-ray, that the electron leaves the interaction.
