The rest mass of certain particles are (approximately): $$D^0$$: $$1865\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$; $$K^+,K^-$$: $$494\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$; $$\pi^+$$: $$140\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$; $$\mu^+$$: $$106\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$; $$nu_{\mu}$$: $$0\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$. **NOTE**: all answers are numbers.

**(a)** A neutral $$D$$ particle is observed to decay to two charged kaons ($$D^0\to{K^+}K^-$$). The decay is observed in the rest frame of the $$D^0$$.
 - **(i)** What is the rest energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of each of the kaons?
 - **(ii)** What is the kinetic energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of each of the kaons?
 - **(iii)** What is the total energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of each of the kaons?
 - **(iv)** What is the speed (in terms of $$c$$) of each of the kaons?

**(b)** A charged pion is seen to decay to a charged muon and a neutrino ($$\pi^+\to\mu^+\nu_{\mu}$$). The decay is observed in the rest frame of the $$\pi^+$$.
 - **(i)** What is the total energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of the $$\mu^+$$?
 - **(ii)** What is the total energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of the $$\nu_{\mu}$$?
*Hint*: The answers to the two parts of question (b) are NOT the same.
