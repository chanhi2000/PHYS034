In the Bohr model of the atom, an electron exhibits uniform circular motion around a nucleus of Z protons.

**(a)** Follow Bohrâ€™s approach to show that the electron radii are quantized, according to
$$
r_n=\frac{\hbar^2n^2}{m_ekZe^2}
$$
where $$k$$ is the Coulomb constant and $$e$$ is the absolute magnitude of the charge of an electron or proton.

**(b)** Using values found on the first page of the test, find a value for $$k$$ times $$e^2$$.
