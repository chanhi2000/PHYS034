**(a)** Find the wavelength in Angtroms of a photon of energy $$E=2\:\text{eV}$$.

**(b)** Is the photon from part (a) in the visible? How do you know?

**(c)** The photon from part (a) strikes a metal surface; the work function of the metal is $$\phi_0=0.5\:\text{eV}$$. What is the maximum kinetic energy in $$\text{eV}$$ of an electron liberated in a photoelectric process?

**(d)** A photon of initial wavelength $$\lambda_0=0.05\:\unicode{xC5}$$ undergoes Compton interaction with an electron and scatters at an angle $$\theta=180^{\circ}$$, that it is, it scatters in a direction directly opposite to
its initial direction. What is the wavelength in Angtroms of the scattered photon?

**(e)** What is the kinetic energy in keV of the electron in part (d) after the scatter?

**(f)** What is the relativistic gamma of the electron in part d) after the scatter?
