##3.
The $$\phi$$ particle most often decays to a $$K^+K^-$$ pair. The rest mass of the $$\phi$$ is $$1020\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$; the rest mass of a charged Kaon is $$494\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$. A $$\phi$$ is observed moving through a laboratory at velocity $$v=0.8c$$.

**(a)** What is the kinetic energy of each of the Kaons, as measured from a frame at rest with respect to the $$\phi$$?

**(b)** If the $$K^+$$ moves in the same direction as the original $$\phi$$ direction, in which direction does the $$K^-$$ move after the decay? Explain. If there is no way to know, say so and explain why.

**(c)** What is the velocity of the $$K^+$$ as measured in the rest frame?

**(d)** What is the velocity of the $$K^+$$ as measured in the lab frame?
