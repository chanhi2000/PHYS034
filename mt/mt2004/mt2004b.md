##2.
A rocket which travels at velocity $$v=0.8c$$ (as measured by an earth-bound observer) will travel to the star α-Centauri. α-Centauri is a distance $$D=4.3\:\text{l.y.}$$ from earth.

**(a)** How long (in time) does the trip take as measured by an earth-bound observer?

**(b)** How far (in distance) is α-Centauri from earth, as measured by an observer on the ship?

**(c)** How long (in time) does the trip take as measured by an observer on the ship?

**(d)** Use the Lorentz transformations for distance and time to show that velocity transforms between a frame $$S$$ and a frame $$S’$$ moving with velocity $$\mathbf{V}$$ relative to $$S$$ according to
$$
v_x'=\frac{v_x-\mathbf{V}}{1-\frac{\mathbf{V}}{c^2}v_x}
$$

**(e)** Use the result of part (d) to find the velocity of a beam of laser light aimed back towards the earth from the rocket, as measured by an observer on earth.
