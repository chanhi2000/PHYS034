The neutral Λ particle can decay into a proton and a pion, that is, $$\Lambda\to{p}+\pi^-$$. The rest
mass of the proton is $$m_p=938.3\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$ and the rest mass of the charged pion is $$m_{\pi}=140\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$. In a certain experiment it is observed that the $$p$$ and $$\pi^-$$ leave the decay moving in the same direction, the proton with momentum $$p_p=581\:\text{MeV}/c$$ and the pion with $$p_π=256\:\text{MeV}/c$$. Determine the rest mass of the $$\Lambda$$.
