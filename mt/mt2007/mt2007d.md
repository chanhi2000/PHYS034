##4.
A photon of wavelength $$\lambda=.02\unicode{xC5}$$ Compton scatters off an electron at rest. The
scattered photon is observed to leave the interaction at an angle of $$\theta=50^{\circ}$$ with respect to the direction of the incoming photon.

**(a)** Find the kinetic energy of the scattered electron.

**(b)** Find the velocity (in terms of $$c$$) of the scattered electron.
