Physicists of the mid- to late-19th century were puzzled by the disagreement between
theoretical prediction and experimental observation of spectral radiancy versus frequency in blackbody radiation, as shown in the figure. Explain why Planck's postulate of quantization of energy solved the problem. You can use words, physics, math, or any combination that explains as completely as possible, but note that this is not intended to be an essay question. Be brief and to the point!
