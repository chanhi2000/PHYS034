##1.
The Starship Enterprise is approaching an intergalactic tunnel. Admiral Kirk, who is
standing on the walkway above the entrance to tunnel, sees the Enterprise approaching at velocity $$V_{\text{SE}}=0.8c$$. Kirk measures the length of the Enterprise to be $$L_{\text{SE}}=200\:\text{m}$$. He measures the length of the tunnel to be $$L_T=10^{11}\:\text{m}$$.

**(a)** How long (in meters) is the Enterprise as measured in its rest frame?

**(b)** How long (in meters) is the tunnel as measured in its rest frame?

**(c)** How long (in meters) is the tunnel as measured by an observer on board the Enterprise?

**(d)** How long (in seconds) after the nose of the Enterprise enters the tunnel does Kirk see the nose of the Enterprise come out of the other end of the tunnel?

**(e)** How long (in seconds) after the nose of the Enterprise enters the tunnel does
an observer on board the Enterprise see the nose of the Enterprise come out of the other end of the tunnel?
