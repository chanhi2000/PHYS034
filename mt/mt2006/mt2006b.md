A neutral $$B$$ particle decays into a pair of charged $$D$$ particles, that is, $$B^0\to{D^+}{D^â€“}$$. The decay is symmetric, that is, in the rest frame of the $$B^0$$ the $$D$$ particles go off in exactly opposite directions with exactly the same kinetic energy. The rest mass of the $$B^0$$ is $$m(B^0)=5279\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$ and the rest mass of the charged D is $$m(D^\pm)=1869\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$.

**(a)** As viewed in the rest frame of the $$B^0$$, find the velocity of the two $$D$$ particles. State your answer as a fraction times the speed of light.

**(b)** The $$B^0$$ has non-zero kinetic energy as viewed in the lab. Consider the case in which the two $$D$$ particles leave the decay point along the line that the $$B^0$$ had been traveling. If one of the $$D$$ particles is observed in the lab frame to have velocity equal to ZERO, find the velocity of the other $$D$$ as measured in the lab frame. State your answer as a fraction times the speed of light.
