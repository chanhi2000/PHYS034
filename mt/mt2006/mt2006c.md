##3.
A 20-W monochromatic light bulb emits photons of wavelength $$\lambda=50\:\unicode{xC5}$$ isotropically. The bulb is placed a distance $$D=4\:\text{m}$$ from a Lithium target of cross-sectional area $$2\:\text{cm}$$ by $$3\:\text{cm}$$. The work function of Lithium is $$\phi_{0}=2.42\:\text{eV}$$.

**(a)** Is the light from this bulb visible to humans? Justify your answer.

**(b)** Find the energy (in $$\text{eV}$$) of one of the photons radiated by the bulb.

**(c)** Find the number of photons per second radiated by the bulb.

**(d)** Find the photoelectric current arising in the target, assuming ideal conditions. Express
your answer in electrons per second.

**(e)** If the energy of the radiated photons is increased, but all other aspects of this setup remain the same, will the photoelectric current increase, decrease, or stay the same? Justify your answer.
