##4.
A photon of energy $$E_\gamma=2\:\text{MeV}$$ Compton scatters off a quasi-free electron in a target at an angle $$\theta=180^{\circ}$$.

**(a)** Find the energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of the scattered photon.

**(b)** Find the total energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of the electron after the scatter occurs.

**(c)** Using only the constants on the first page of this exam, show that the value of the Compton wavelength given on the first page is about right.
