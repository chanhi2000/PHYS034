The neutral $$\omega$$ particle decays into a pair of charged pions: $$\omega\to\pi^+\pi^-$$. The rest mass of the $$\omega$$ is $$m_\omega=782\:\text{Mev}/c^2$$, and the mass of a charged pion is $$m_\pi=140\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$. The decay of a particular $$\omega$$ particle is observed in which the $$\pi^+$$ and $$\pi^-$$ each carry the same kinetic energy.

**(a)** Find the total energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of one of the pions in the rest frame of the $$\omega$$.

**(b)** Find the kinetic energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of one of the pions in the rest frame of the $$\omega$$.

**(c)**Find the velocity (to 3 digits, in terms of $$c$$) of one of the pions in the rest frame of the $$\omega$$.

**(d)** The $$\omega$$ particle is moving through the lab at $$v=0.7c$$ when it decays. The $$\pi^+$$ is thrown
directly forward relative to the direction of the $$\omega$$. Find the velocity (to 3 digits, in terms of $$c$$) of the $$\pi^+$$ as measured in the lab frame.
