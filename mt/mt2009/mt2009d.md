##4.
A photon of wavelength $$\lambda=0.0700\:\unicode{xC5}$$ Compton scatters off an electron at rest. The scattered photon comes out of the interaction at an angle of $$\theta=48.19^{\circ}$$.

**(a)** Find the wavelength $$\lambda'$$ (in $$\unicode{xC5}$$) of the scattered photon.

**(b)** Find the kinetic energy (in $$\text{eV}$$) of the electron after the photon strikes it.

**(c)** Find the angle $$\phi$$ at which the electron leaves
the interaction.
