##3.
A 100-W bulb shines on a target made from a metal that has work function $$\phi_0=4.0\:\text{eV}$$. The frequency of the bulb is just barely sufficient to liberate electrons from the surface of the metal via the photoelectric effect.

**(a)** Find the frequency (in $$\text{Hz}$$) of the light.

**(b)** Is the light from the bulb visible to humans? Explain how you know.

**(c)** How many photons per second are emitted by the bulb?

**(d)** What is the maximum kinetic energy (in $$\text{eV}$$) of an electron liberated from the metal?

**(e)** What is the maximum kinetic energy (in $$\text{eV}$$) of an electron liberated from a Lithium target, with $$\phi_0=4.0\:\text{eV}$$, placed in front of this bulb?
