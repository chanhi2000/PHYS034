##1.
The Klingons are shocked to observe the Galactic Rod, a rigid cylinder of proper length $$L_p=1000\:\text{m}$$, heading straight toward Qo’noS (their home planet) at a speed of $$0.8c$$. There is no relative motion between the two except along the path of the rod. To avoid a catastrophic collision the Klingons cleverly drill a hole along the 19,500-km diameter of Qo’noS, and also stop the planet from rotating; in this way, the Galactic Rod will pass harmlessly through the planet. A team of Klingon scientists are sent to ride on the Galactic Rod.

**(a)** How long (in $$\text{m}$$) does the Galactic Rod appear to the Klingon scientists sent to ride on it?

**(b)** How long (in $$\text{m}$$) does the Galactic Rod appear to Klingons on Qo’noS?

**(c)** The scientists set up a huge clock, marked off in seconds, on the Galactic Rod. How long (in $$\text{s}$$) does it take for the clock to tick once, as observed by the scientists sent to ride on it?

**(d)** How long (in $$\text{s}$$) does it take for the clock on the Galactic Rod to tick once, as observed by Klingons on Qo’noS?

**(e)** One of the scientists riding on the rod fires a laser toward Qo’noS as a signal. Find the speed (in terms of $$c$$) of this light as observed by Klingons on the planet. By “find” I mean use the Lorentz contraction – don’t just guess!
