When the USS LongCylinder was built in space dock its length, defined as the distance from the “front” to the “back,” was $$1000\:\text{m}$$. An accurate clock, with a hand that ticks off 1 second at a time, was installed on bridge. Bronson Steele, the captain of the USS LongCylinder, normally flies it so that the direction of motion is aligned with the length of the ship. The USS LongCylinder zooms past Earth at a speed of $$0.4c$$ as measured by an Earthbound observer. (Neglect any effects due to Earth’s rotation.)

**(a)** How long (in $$\text{m}$$) does the USS LongCylinder appear to Captain Steele?

**(b)** How long (in $$\text{m}$$) does the USS LongCylinder appear to the Earthbound observer?

**(c)** How long (in $$\text{s}$$) does it take for the clock on the bridge to tick off 10 seconds, as observed by Captain Steele?

**(d)** How long (in $$\text{s}$$) does it take for the clock on the bridge to tick off 10 seconds, as observed by the Earthbound observer (who looks through a telescope to see the clock)?

**(e)** As he zooms past Earth, Capt. Steele fires his forward laser so that a beam of light is emitted straight out from the front of the ship. How fast does the laser light travel, as observed by Capt. Steele? A good guess without other proof is acceptable.

**(f)** As he zooms past Earth, Capt. Steele fires his forward laser so that a beam of light is emitted straight out from the front of the ship. How fast does the laser light travel, as observed by an Earthbound observer? A good guess is worth 2 points; full credit requires proof using the Lorentz contraction!

**(g)** When the USS LongCylinder zooms past Earth at speed v0 as measured by an Earthbound observer, the observer measures its length to be $$L_0$$. If the ship’s speed is increased to $$2v_0$$, what is the length of the ship as measured by an Earthbound observer?
- (i) $$2L_0$$
- (ii) $$\frac{L_0}{2}$$
- (iii) $$\frac{L_0}{\sqrt{2}}$$
- (iv) Some constant times $$L_0$$, but not one of the choices provided.
- (v) The measured length depends on the specific value of $$v_0$$.

**(h)** Capt. Steele decides to fly the USS LongCylinder so that its length is at a $$30^{\circ}$$ angle to the to the direction of motion. How long from “front” to “back” (in $$\text{m}$$) does the ship appear to an Earthbound observer who measures its speed to be $$0.4c$$?

Some decay processes...
**(a)** What is the wavelength (in $$\text{nm}$$) of a photon that can pair produce a positron-electron pair ($$\gamma\to{e}^+e^-$$) each with 50 keV of kinetic energy?

**(b)** A particle known as the $$\text{J}/\Psi$$ can decay to pair of charged muons ($$\text{J}/\Psi\to\mu^+mu^-$$). In the rest frame of the $$\text{J}/\Psi$$ the decay is symmetric; what is the kinetic energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of each muon?

**(c)** A particle known as the $$\text{J}/\Psi$$ can decay to pair of charged muons ($$\text{J}/\Psi\to\mu^+mu^-$$). In the rest frame of the $$\text{J}/\Psi$$ the decay is symmetric; what is the speed (in terms of $$c$$) of each muon?

A 0.1 W isotropic light source emits photons of wavelength $$\lambda=490\:\text{nm}$$. Light from this bulb falls on a Lithium target, which has a work function $$\phi_0=2.3\:\text{eV}$$

**(a)** The human eye responds to light if more than 60 photons per second enter the pupil. What is the maximum distance (in $$\text{km}$$) at which this light source would be observable, assuming no light is absorbed between the bulb and the person? In the dark the pupil is typically open to a radius of $$6\:\text{mm}$$.

**(b)** Find the frequency (in $$\text{Hz}$$) of the light.

**(c)** What is the maximum kinetic energy (in $$\text{eV}$$) of an electron liberated from the Lithium target?


##4.
The Sun radiates like a blackbody, with surface temperature of $$5800\:\text{K}$$. The mass of the Sun is $$2\times10^{30}\:\text{kg}$$, and the radius of the Sun is $$7\times10^8\:\text{m}$$.

**(a)** Find the Sun’s total power output (in $$\text{W}$$).

**(b)** Assuming the rate at which the Sun radiates is constant, how long will it take (in years) for the Sun to disappear?

**(c)** In one step in the fusion process by which energy is released in the Sun, two protons fuse together to form a deuteron. In this process a positron and a neutrino are created ($$p+p\to{d}+e^++v_e$$). About how much energy (in $$MeV$$) is released in this process? Treat the neutrino as massless. (“About” because the real process is not quite as described here.)
