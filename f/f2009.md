Bohr developed his atomic theory by requiring that the angular momentum of an electron in a circular orbit around a nucleus be quantized in units of $$\hbar$$.

**(a)** Show that the velocity of electrons in a Bohr hydrogen atom is quantized, specifically, find an expression for velocity that depends only on an integer quantum number $$n$$ and physical constants. (If your answer includes quantities other than $$n$$ that are variables, it’s not complete.)

**(b)** Express your answer to part a) in terms of $$c$$, the speed of light. (If you haven’t already...)

**(c)** Find the speed of an electron in the $$n=4$$ orbit of a hydrogen atom. Your answer can be a number or a number times $$c$$.

An electron of energy $$E$$ encounters a potential step of height $$V_0$$, where $$E$$ is less than $$V_0$$. In the picture, the electron is moving from left to right.

The wave function for the electron is $$\Psi(x,\:t)=A\sin{\left(\tfrac{2mE}{\hbar^2} x\right)}e^{j\omega{t}}$$, where $$m$$, $$E$$, and $$\omega$$ are the mass, energy, and angular frequency of the electron respectively, and $$A$$ is a normalization constant.
