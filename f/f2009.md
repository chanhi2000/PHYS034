## 1.
Bohr developed his atomic theory by requiring that the angular momentum of an electron in a circular orbit around a nucleus be quantized in units of   .
a) Show that the velocity of electrons in a Bohr hydrogen atom is quantized, specifically, find an
expression for velocity that depends only on an integer quantum number n and physical
constants. (If your answer includes quantities other than n that are variables, it’s not complete.)
b) Express your answer to part a) in terms of c, the speed of light. (If you haven’t already...)
c) Find the speed of an electron in the n = 4 orbit of a hydrogen atom. Your answer can be a
number or a number times c.
