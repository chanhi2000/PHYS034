A neutral pion ($$\pi^0$$) of rest mass $$135\:\tfrac{\text{MeV}}{c^2}$$ has $$75\:\text{MeV}$$ of kinetic energy.

**(a)** What is its De Broglie wavelength in $$F$$ ($$1\:\text{F}=10^{-15}\:\text{m}$$)?

**(b)** What is its relativistic $$\gamma$$ (gamma)?

**(c)** The $$\pi^0$$ decays into a symmetric electron-positron pair.  In terms of the speed of light, what is the velocity of the electron and of the positron *as observed from the rest frame of the* $$\pi^0$$?

**(d)** The strong nuclear force has been modeled as protons and neutrons continuously emitting and either reabsorbing or exchanging “virtual” neutral pions. However, energy is not conserved in processes like $$p\to{p}+\pi^0$$. Explain briefly how nature allows this violation of energy conservation.

**(e)** Estimate the range of the strong force in $$\text{F}$$ by determining the distance that a virtual neutral pion (as in part d) can travel.

**(b)** The nucleus of a $$^{90}\text{Sr}$$ atom contains 38 protons and 52 neutrons.  Given $$m_p$$ is the mass of a proton and $$m_n$$ is the mass of a neutron, how does the mass of the $$^{90}\text{Sr}$$ nucleus compare with $$38m_p+52m_n$$?

## 3.
An electron of energy $$E$$ (traveling left to right in the figure) encounters an abrupt change in potential from $$V=0$$ to $$V=V_0$$ at $$x=0$$. $$V_0$$ is less than $$E$$, that is,$$V_0<E$$.

**(a)** Write a general wave function $$\phi(x)$$ that solves the Schrödinger equation in the region $$x<0$$ and also in the region $$x>0$$.  By “general” I mean that you should leave the amplitudes as variables.

**(b)** Find an expression, expressed in terms of $$k_1=\sqrt{\tfrac{2m_eE}{\hbar^2}}$$ and $$k_2=\sqrt{\tfrac{2m_e(E-V_0)}{\hbar^2}}$$ for the probability that the electron will get reflected back from the step.

**(c)** Show that your result for part b) gives sensible results for $$E=V_0$$ and also for $$E\to\infty$$.  I will give you the answer to part b) in exchange for points, if you ask.


## 4.
The time-independent wave function which describes a particle confined to the one-dimensional region $$-a<x<+a$$ is given by $$\phi(x)=A\sqrt{a^2-x^2}$$, where $$A$$ is a normalization constant.

**(a)** Find the normalization constant $$A$$.

**(b)** Find the probability of measuring the particle’s position to be in the range $$–\tfrac{a}{2}<x<+\tfrac{a}{2}$$. Your answer should be a number, for example, $$30\%$$. ($$30\%$$ is NOT the answer—it’s just an example of the form of the answer.)

$$^{14}\text{C}$$ is a radioactive isotope of carbon. In naturally occurring $$\text{CO}_2$$, the ratio of $$^{14}\text{C}$$ to $$^{12}\text{C}$$ is $$1.3\times10^{-12}$$.  The half life of $$^{14}\text{C}$$ is 5730 years.
