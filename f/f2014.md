## 1.
An electron has kinetic energy of $$0.300\:\text{MeV}$$.

**(a)** Find the speed of the electron. Your answer should be a number with units.

**(b)** Find the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. Your answer should be a number with units.

**(c)** Could this electron be used in an electron microscope to create images of individual atoms on a surface? Explain briefly.


## 2.
An electron is trapped in a one-dimensional infinite square well defined by $$V=0$$ for $$0\leq{x}\leq{L}$$. and $$V\to\infty$$ for $$x$$ outside this range.  The time-independent part of the wavefunction for this electron is $$\phi(x)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin{\left(\sqrt{\tfrac{2m_eE}{h^2}}x\right)}$$, where $$m_e$$ is the rest mass of an electron and $$E$$ is the energy of the electron.

**(a)** Show that the probability of finding the electron somewhere in $$0\leq{x}\leq{L}$$ is $$100\%$$.

**(b)** Show that the allowed energies of the electron are quantized according to $$E_n=\tfrac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2m_eL^2}$$, where $$n$$ can take on integer values 1, 2, 3, and so on.

**(c)** Find the wavelength of the radiation emitted if the electron were to make a transition from the $$n=3$$ to the $$n=2$$ level, in a well of width $$0.2\:\text{nm}$$. Your answer should be a number with units.


## 3.
Bohr modeled the atom by considering a single electron in a circular orbit around a nucleus. He quantized the electron’s angular momentum in terms of integer multiples of $$\hbar$$, that is, he let $$L=m_evr=n\hbar$$, where $$m_e$$ is the rest mass of the electron, $$v$$ is its orbital speed, and $$r$$ is the radius of the orbit.  In Bohr’s model the electron is bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force.  Imagine instead a “grydrogen” atom formed by a proton and an electron bound by the gravitational force $$\bar{F}=-\tfrac{Gm_pm_e}{r^2}\hat{r}$$, where $$m_p$$ is the rest mass of the proton and $$m_e$$ is the rest mass of the electron.

**(a)** Find the radius of the ground state orbit of the electron in grydrogen. Your answer should be a number with units.

**(b)** Using your answer to part (a) find the time it would take light to travel from the proton to the electron in the ground state orbit in grydrogen. Express your answer as a ratio between this time and the approximate age of the Universe.  You answer should be a number.  (No, the age of the Universe is not on the data sheet.  You can, if you choose, “buy” the age of the Universe from me for some of the points that this question is worth.)


## 4.
A beam of electrons of kinetic energy $$E$$, initially moving from left to right, experience a potential described by $$V=V_0$$ for $$x<0$$, $$V=0$$ for $$0<x<L$$, and $$V=\infty$$ for $$x>L$$. Note that $$E>V_0$$. Also, please use the standard convention that left to right motion is taken to be in the positive direction.

**(a)** Write out the time-independent Schrödinger equation that applies to each region in this space.

**(b)** Determine the probability that any particular electron will get reflected back to the left as the beam initially arrives at $$x=0$$.  Your can use any of the variables given to express your answer.

**(c)** Evaluate your answer to part (b) for the case in which $$E=10.9\:\text{eV}$$, $$V_0=9.31\:\text{eV}$$, and $$L=0.3\:\text{nm}$$. You may need all or only some of these values.  Your answer should be a number with units.

**(d)** For the case described in part (c), how long after a beam of 100 electrons first arrives at $$x=0$$ can you expect that all 100 of the electrons will be moving to the left in the region $$x<0$$?  Your answer should be a number with units.  The electrons travel at $$6.53\times10^{–3}\:c$$. (If you are not confident about your answer to part (c), make up a reasonable answer for part (c), tell me what you picked, and use it to do part (d).)


## 5.
Certain nuclear isotopes are radioactive.

**(a)** An isotope of plutonium, $$^{244}\text{Pu}$$, emits alpha radiation. Write out the alpha decay of $$^{244}\text{Pu}$$, showing carefully all decay products.  Make sure to indicate all relevant properties of each, for example, if $$^{244}\text{Pu}$$ were one of them, write “$$^{244}\text{Pu}$$”, not “$$\text{Pu}$$”!

**(b)** An isotope of potassium, $$^{40}\text{K}$$, can decay either via beta minus or beta plus decay. Write out both processes, showing carefully all decay products.

**(c)** An nucleus radiates because it is energetically favorable to do so. How much energy is released in the beta minus decay of $$^{14}\text{C}$$? Your answer should be a number with units.

**(d)** The largest stable nucleus contains 82 protons and neutrons, as you can see from the graph on the data sheet at the back of this test. (It is as isotope of lead.) Briefly explain why it is reasonable that nuclei larger than this would not be stable.

**(e)** In a strange parallel universe two boron nuclei can fuse together to form deuterium plus an isotope of fluorine: $$^{10}\text{B}+^{10}\text{B}\to^{2}\text{H}+^{18}\text{F}$$.  How much energy is released in this process?  Your answer should be a number with units.


## 6.
You stand atop a wide, cylindrical pipe floating in space. (It could happen!)  A metal rod is shot into the pipe at a speed close to $$c$$.
![fig02](f/f2014/f2014-fig02.png)

**(a)** If the proper length of the rod is $$100\:\text{m}$$ and it is traveling at $$0.872c$$, how long does the rod appear to you from your vantage point atop the pipe?

**(b)** You note that at a certain instant the rod exactly fits in the pipe.  However, you know that if you had been standing on the rod, the length of the pipe would be contracted, and thus you would expect that the rod would not fit inside the pipe.  How is this possible? Explain briefly.


## 7.
Silicon ($$\text{Si}$$) is a semiconductor. If a lattice of silicon atoms is doped with arsenic ($$\text{As}$$), will this augment the conductive properties of the material by contributing electrons or holes?  Explain briefly.
