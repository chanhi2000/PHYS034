Consider a 1-dimensional infinite well in which the potential is zero for $$0<x<L$$ and infinite elsewhere.  An electron is trapped in this well.
![fig01](f/f2013/f2013-fig01.png)

**(a)** Write the time-independent Schrödinger equation for the region $$0<x<L$$, in terms of a wave function $$\phi(x)$$.

**(b)** Start by substituting $$\phi(x)=A\sin{(kx)}$$ into the equation you wrote in part (a) in order to prove that this $$\phi(x)$$ is a solution to it.

**(c)** Find an expression for $$k$$ in terms of the mass and energy of the electron.

**(d)** What boundary condition(s) must be applied at $$x=0$$ and $$x=L$$?

**(e)** Show that the energy levels of the electron are quantized according to $$E_n=\tfrac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2m_eL^2}$$, where $$m_e$$ is the rest mass of an electron.

**(f)** The electron makes a transition from the $$n=3$$ energy state to the $$n=2$$ energy state in a well of width $$L=0.2\:\text{nm}$$.  Find the wavelength of the emitted photon. Your answer should be a number (in $$\text{nm}$$).


## 2.
A potential is defined only in the region $$–\tfrac{2}{3}<x<+\tfrac{2}{3}$$. The solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this situation is the wavefunction $$\phi(x)=4-9x^{2}$$.

**(a)** Does this wavefunction correspond to a real, physical state?  Explain briefly.

**(b)** If the wavefunction *does* not correspond to a real, physical state, make whatever adjustment is necessary so that it does.  If the wavefunction *does* correspond to a real, physical state, augment it to form a correct time dependent wave function $$\Psi(x,t)$$.

Bohr modeled the atom by considering a single electron in a circular orbit around a nucleus, and quantizing the electron’s angular momentum in terms of integer multiples of $$\hbar$$.  That is, he let $$L=m_evr=n\hbar$$, where $$m_e$$ is the rest mass of the electron, $$v$$ is its orbital speed, and $$r$$ is the radius of the orbit.  In Bohr’s model the electron is bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force.  Imagine that a new force is discovered which allows an electron to be bound to a “G particle” to form a “G atom.”  The force on the electron due to the G is $$\bar{F}=-\tfrac{\alpha{a}_0^2hc}{2\pi{r}^4}\hat{r}$$, where $$a_0$$ is the Bohr radius, $$\alpha$$ is the fine structure constant,  and $$r$$ is the center-to-center distance between the G and the electron.  Consider a Bohr model of a G atom.

**(a)** Show that the radius of the nth orbit of the Bohr G atom is given by $$r_n=\tfrac{2\pi(\alpha{a}_0^2E_{e,0})}{hc}\tfrac{1}{n^2}$$, where $$E_{e,0}$$ is the rest energy of the electron.

**(b)** It can be shown that the total energy of an electron orbiting a G atom is given by the expression $$E=-\tfrac{h^4c^4}{6(2\pi)^4\alpha^2{a}_0^4m_e^3c^6}$$. Show that this expression has dimensions of energy.

**(c)** Find the speed (in terms of $$c$$) of the electron in the $$n=1$$ orbit in a Bohr G atom.

Binding energy has played a role in many aspects of
physics we discussed in this course.

**(a)** Using data on the last page, determine the binding energy (in $$\text{MeV}$$) of a $$^{4}\text{He}$$ nucleus.

**(b)** When a neutron collides with a $$^{235}\text{U}$$ nucleus it can produce an unstable $$^{236}\text{U}$$ nucleus which splits into a $$^{141}\text{Ba}$$ nucleus and a $$^{92}\text{Kr}$$ nucleus.  How many neutrons are released in this process?

**(c)** Using data on the last page, determine the energy released (in $$\text{MeV}$$) in the fission process
described in part (b).

**(d)** In the final step of the fusion cycle by which our sun produces power, two $$^{3}\text{He}$$ nuclei fuse to form $$^{4}\text{He}$$, accompanied by the release of two hydrogen nuclei: $$^{3}\text{He}+^{3}\text{He}\to^{4}\text{He}+2(^{1}\text{H})$$. Using data on the last page, determine the energy released (in $$\text{MeV}$$) in this process.


## 5.
Consider a neutron carrying $$50\:\text{MeV}$$ of kinetic energy.

**(a)** Find the speed (in terms of $$c$$) of the neutron.

**(b)** Find the de Broglie wavelength (in $$\text{fm}$$) of the neutron.

**(c)** At approximately what speed (in terms of $$c$$) would a $$^{235}\text{U}$$ nucleus need to travel to have the same de Boglie wavelength as a $$50\:\text{MeV}$$ neutron?
