## 1. 
An electron has total energy $$E=5\:\text{MeV}$$.
a) Find the electron’s kinetic energy.
b) Find the electron’s relativistic gamma.
c) Find the electron’s velocity, in terms of $$c$$, the speed of light.


## 2.
From fundamental physics relationships which photons obey, show that the equality $$p=\hbar{k}$$ correct.


## 3.
Energy considerations have played a major role in many topics we discussed this term. Discuss briefly how energy plays a role in nuclear fission and fusion, in the context of the plot of binding energy per nucleon versus atomic number.

## 4.
A new force is discovered which allows an electron to be bound to a "$$G$$ particle" to form a "$$G$$ atom."  The attractive force between the $$G$$ and the electron is $$F=\frac{b}{r^4}$$ where $$b=\alpha{a}_0^2\hbar{c}$$, where $$a_0$$ is the Bohr radius and $$\alpha$$ is the fine structure constant.  The potential energy between the $$G$$ and $$e^-$$ is therefore $$U=-\frac{b}{3r^3}$$.

a) Given that angular momentum is quantized in units of $$\hbar$$, that is, $$L=n\hbar$$, find an expression for the radii of electron orbits that shows these radii are quantized. Assume circular orbits.
b) It can be shown that the total energy of an orbiting electron is given by the expression $$E=-\frac{(n^2\hbar^2)^3}{6b^2m^3}$$, where $$m$$ is the mass of the electron. Show that this expression has dimensions of energy.

c) Find the wavelength of a photon (in $$\unicode{xC5}$$) emitted when an electron in a “$$G$$ atom” makes a
transition from the $$n=2$$ to the $$n=1$$ state.  All constants you need can be found on the first page of this test.


## 5.
An electron is trapped within the region $$0<x<L$$. The potential is equal to $$0$$ in this region and is infinite everywhere else
**(a)** Write the time-independent Schrödinger equation as it applies to the region $$0<x<L$$.

**(b)** Write a solution to the equation in part a) in the form$$\phi(x)=A\sin{(ax)}+B\cos{(bx)}$$, where $$A$$ and $$B$$ are constants (to be determined in part c) and $$a$$ and $$b$$ are whatever you need to make this $$\phi(x)$$ the general solution to the Schrödinger equation.

**(c)** Using boundary conditions and the normalization requirement, find values for $$A$$ and $$B$$.

**(d)** Show that the energy states in for this trapped electron are given by $$E_n=\frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$$

**(e)** Find the probability that an electron in the $$n=1$$ energy state will be found between $$x=0$$ and $$x=L$$


## 6.
The semi-empirical mass formula is an approximation of the nuclear binding energy $$E_B$$ given the $$N$$, $$Z$$, and $$A$$ of a particular nucleus:
