Î‘ 40 W incandescent bulb radiates from a tungsten filament operating at $$3300\:\text{K}$$. Assuming that the bulb radiates like a blackbody,

**(a)** What are the frequency $$f_m$$ and the wavelength $$\lambda_m$$ at the maximum of the spectral distribution?

**(b)** If fm is a good approximation of the average frequency of the photons emitted by the bulb, about how many photons is the bulb radiating per second?

**(c)** If you are looking at the bulb from $$5\:\text{m}$$ away, how many photons enter your eye per second? (The diameter of your pupil is about $$5.0\:\text{mm}.)w
