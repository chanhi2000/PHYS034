A particular radiating cavity has the maximum of its spectral distribution of radiated power at a wavelength of $$27.0\:\mu\text{m}$$ (in the infrared region of the spectrum).  The temperature is then changed so that the total power radiated by the cavity doubles.

**(a)** Compute the new temperature.

**(b)** At what wavelength does the new spectral distribution have its maximum value?
