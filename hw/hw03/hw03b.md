**2.56(a)**

An unstable particle of mass $$M$$ decays into two identical particles, each of mass $$m$$. Obtain an expression for the velocities of the two decay particles in the lab frame

**(a)** if $$M$$ is at rest in the lab and

**(b)** if $$M$$ has total energy $$4mc^2$$ when it decays and the decay particles move along the direction of $$M$$.
