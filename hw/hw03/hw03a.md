The neutral kaon particle ($$K^0$$) has rest mass $$m_K=498\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$ and can decay to two charged pions ($$\pi^+$$ and $$\pi^-$$), each of mass $$m_{\pi}=140\:\text{MeV}/c^2$$.  This process can be summarized as $$K^0\to\pi^++\pi^-$$.

**(a)** A $$K^0 at rest in a physics lab decays to two pions.  Find the energy and speed of the two pions, assuming the decay is symmetric, as observed in the lab. “Symmetric” means that the two pions go off $$180^{\circ}$$ apart, each with the same energy.

**(b)** A $$K^0$$ moving at $$v=0.8c$$ relative to the lab decays to two pions.  In a frame at rest with respect to the $$K^0$$ the pions are emitted symmetrically, and perpendicular to the direction of the path of the $$K^0$$ path through the lab.  Find the angle (with respect to the direction of the $$K^0$$) that each pion makes as observed in the lab.
