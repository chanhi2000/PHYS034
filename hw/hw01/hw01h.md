A burst of $$p+$$ mesons (pions) travels down an evacuated beam tube at Fermilab moving at $$\beta=0.92$$ with respect to the laboratory.

**(a)** Compute $$\gamma$$ for this group of pions.

**(b)** The proper mean lifetime of pions is $$2.6\times10^{-8}\:\text{s}$$.  What mean lifetime is measured in the lab?

**(c)** If the burst contained 50,000 pions, how many remain after the group has traveled $$50\:\text{m}$$ down the beam tube?

**(d)** What would be the answer to (c) ignoring time dilation?
