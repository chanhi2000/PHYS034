The proper mean lifetime of $$\pi$$ mesons (pions) is $$2.6\times10^{-8}\:\text{s}$$.  Suppose a beam of such particles has speed $$0.9c$$.
**(a)** What would their mean life be as measured in the laboratory?

**(b)** How far would they travel (on the average) before they decay?

**(c)** What would your answer be to part (3) if you neglected time dilation?

**(d)** What is the interval in spacetime between creation of a typical pion and its decay?
