## 1.10

Suppose that $$A'$$, $$B'$$, and $$C'$$ are at rest in frame $$S'$$, which moves with respect to $$S$$ at speed $$v$$ in the $$+x$$ direction.  Let $$B'$$ be located exactly midway between $$A'$$ and C’.  At t’=0, a light flash occurs at B’ and expands outward as a spherical wave.  
1. According to an observer in $$S'$$, do the wave fronts arrive at $$A'$$ and $$C'$$ simultaneously?  
2. According to an observer in $$S$$, do the wave fronts arrive at $$A'$$ and $$C'$$ simultaneously?
3. If you answered *no* to either (1) or (2), what is the difference in their arrival times and at which point did the front arrive first?

#### 1.10.1
> according to $$S'$$ frame, the wave fronts arrive simultaneously at $$A'$$, and $$C'$$.

#### 1.10.2
> according to $$S'$$ frame, the wave fronts DO NOT arrive simultaneously at $$A'$$, and $$C'$$.
