**2.4(b,c)**

How much energy would be required to accelerate a particle of mass m from rest to a speed of 

**(b)** $$0.9c$$, and 

**(c)** $$0.99c$$? 

Express your answers as multiples of the rest energy.

**note**: 
Also, the ratio of final speeds between (2) and (3) is $$.99/.9=1.1$$.  What is the ratio of the amount of energy required?
