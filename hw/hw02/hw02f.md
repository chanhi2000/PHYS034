A cosmic-ray proton is moving at such a speed that it can travel from the Moon to Earth in $$1.5\:\text{s}$$. 

**(a)** At what fraction of the speed of light is the proton moving? 

**(b)** What is its kinetic energy? 

**(c)** What value would be measured for its mass by an observer in Earth’s reference frame? 

**(d)** What percent error is made in the kinetic energy by using the classical relation? (The Earth-Moon distance is $$3.8\times10^5\:\text{km}$$. Ignore Earth’s rotation.)
