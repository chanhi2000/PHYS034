An interesting paradox has been suggested by *R. Shaw* that goes like this.  A very thin steel plate with a circular hole $$1\:\text{m}$$ in diameter centered on the $$y$$ axis lies parallel to the $$xz$$ plane in frame $$S$$ and moves in the $$+y$$ direction at constant speed $$v_y$$ as illustrated in **Figure 1-45**.  A meter stick lying on the $$x$$ axis moves in the  $$+x$$ direction with $$β=\frac{v}{c}$$.  The steel plate arrives at the $$y=0$$ plane at the same instant that the center of the meter stick reaches the origin of $$S$$.  Since the meter stick is observed by observers in $$S$$ to be contracted, it passes through the $$1\:\text{m}$$ hole in the plate with no problem.   A paradox appears to arise when one considers that an observer in $$S'$$, the rest system of the meter stick, measures the diameter of the hole in the plate to be contracted in the x dimension and, hence, becomes too small to pass the meter stick, resulting in a collision.  Resolve the paradox.  Will there be a collision?

**note**:  Don’t do any math. Just THINK about this question
