## 6.53(b)
A particle is in the ground state of an infinite square well potential given by Equation 6-21.  Calculate the probability that the particle will be found in the region

**(a)** $$0<x<\tfrac{1}{2}L$$,

**(b)** $$0<x<\tfrac{1}{3}L$$, and

**(c)** $$0<x<\tfrac{3}{4}L$$.

> ###### Equation 6.21
$$
V(x)=\begin{cases}0&0<x<L\\\infty&x<0\:\:\:\:\text{and}\:\:\:\:x>L\end{cases}
$$
