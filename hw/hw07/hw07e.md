## 6.21(a)
In the early days of nuclear physics before the neutron was discovered, it was thought that the nucleus contained only electrons and protons.  If we consider the nucleus to be a one-dimensional infinite well with $$L=10\:\text{fm}$$ and ignore relativity, compute the ground-state energy for

**(a)** an electron and

**(b)** a proton in the nucleus.

**(c)** Compute the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state for each particle. (Differences between energy levels in nuclei are found to be typically of the order of $$1\:\text{MeV}$$.)
