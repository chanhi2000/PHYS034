In the section titled “Step Potential” that starts on page 258 of our book, Tipler and Llewellyn find the reflection and transmission coefficients ($$R$$ and $$T$$) for a beam of particles incident on a step function potential in the case in which the energy of the particles is greater than the step height.  Familiarize yourself with the solution, draw the setup, and write out the solution for $$R$$ and $$T$$.  Note that you will need to fill in the details between equations 6.65 and equations 6.66 and 6.67.
> ###### Equation 6.65
$$
\Psi_{\text{I}}(0)=A+B=\Psi_{\text{II}}(0)=C;\\
k_1A-k_1B=k_2C;
$$

> ###### Equation 6.66 & 6.67
$$
\begin{align*}
B&=\frac{k_1-k_2}{k_1+k_2}A=\frac{E^{\tfrac{1}{2}}-(E-V_0)^{\tfrac{1}{2}}}{E^{\tfrac{1}{2}}+(E-V_0)^{\tfrac{1}{2}}}A\\
C&=\frac{2k_1}{k_1+k_2}A=\frac{2E^{\tfrac{1}{2}}}{E^{\tfrac{1}{2}}+(E-V_0)^{\tfrac{1}{2}}}A
\end{align*}
