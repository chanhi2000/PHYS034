## 6.10(b),(c)
A particle is in the ground state of an infinite square well potential given by Equation 6.21.  Find the probability of finding the particle in the interval $$\Delta{x}=0.002L$$ at

**(a)** $$x=\tfrac{L}{2}$$

**(b)** $$x=\tfrac{2L}{3}$$, and

**(c)** $$x=L$$. (Since $$\Delta{x}$$ is very small, you need not do any integration.)

> ###### Equation 6.21
$$
V(x)=\begin{cases}0&0<x<L\\\infty&x<0\:\:\:\:\text{and}\:\:\:\:x>L\end{cases}
$$
