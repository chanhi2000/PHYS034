## 6.54(a)

**(a)** Show that for large $$n$$, the fractional difference in energy between state $$n$$ and state $$n+1$$ for a particle in an infinite square well is given approximately by
$$
\frac{E_{n+1}-E_n}{E_n}\approx\frac{2}{n}
$$

**(b)** What is the approximate percentage energy difference between the states $$n_1=1000$$ and $$n_2=1001$$?

**(c)** Comment on how this result is related to Bohrâ€™s correspondence principle.
