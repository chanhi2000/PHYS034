Consider a parent nucleus $$\text{P}$$ that radioactively emits an alpha particle $$\alpha$$, leaving a daughter nucleus $$\text{D}$$. ($$\text{P}\to{\text{D}}+\alpha$$).  Consider the moment when the daughter and alpha particle are "right next to" each other:

![fig01](hw09/hw09-fig01.png)

At this moment the Coulomb repulsion is its largest, that is, the Coulomb barrier is highest.  Estimate the height of the Coulomb barrier by considering a nucleus of $$A$$ equal to $$200$$.  Note that we have seen a way to approximate the radius of the nucleus as a function of the atomic number $$A$$. Also, recall the equation you learned in Phys 33 for the Coulomb potential energy. Compare your answer to the value I gave in class for the height of the Coulomb barrier.

## 11.59(modified)
Compute the total energy released in the following set of fusion reactions.  This is the proton-proton cycle, the primary source of the Sunâ€™s energy.

\begin{align*}
^{1}\text{H}+^{1}\text{H}&\to\:^{2}\text{H}+e^+\nu_{e}\\
^{2}\text{H}+^{1}\text{H}&\to\:^{3}\text{H}+\gamma\\
^{3}\text{H}+^{3}\text{H}&\to\:^{4}\text{H}+2^{1}\text{H}+\gamma\\
