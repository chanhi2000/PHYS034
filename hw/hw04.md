The wavelengths of visible light range from about $$380\:\text{nm}$$ to about $$750\:\text{nm}$$. 

**(a)** What is the range of photon energies (in $$\text{eV}$$) in visible light? 

**(b)** A typical FM radio stationâ€™s broadcast frequency is about 100 MHz. What is the energy of an FM photon of that frequency?


##2.

The work function for cesium is $$1.9\:\text{eV}$$, the lowest of any metal. 

**(a)** Find the threshold frequency and wavelength for the photoelectric effect. Find the stopping potential if the wavelength of the incident light is 

**(b)** $$300\:\text{nm}$$ and 

**(c)** $$400\:\text{nm}$$.


##3.

**(a)** If 5 percent of the power of a $$100\:\text{W}$$ bulb is radiated in the visible spectrum, how many visible photons are radiated per second? 

**(b)** If the bulb is a point source radiating equally in all directions, what is the flux of photons (number per unit time per unit area) at a distance of 2 m?


##4.

Under optimum conditions, the eye will perceive a flash if about 60 photons arrive at the cornea. How much energy is this in joules if the wavelength of the light is $$550\:\text{nm}$$?

The longest wavelength of light that will cause emission of electrons from cesium is $$653\:\text{nm}$$. 

**(a)** Compute the work function for cesium. 

**(b)** If light of $$300\:\text{nm}$$ (ultraviolet) were to shine on cesium, what would be the energy of the ejected electrons?
