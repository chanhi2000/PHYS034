In chemistry you learned the ideal gas law, that $$pV=N_AkT$$. (Pressure, volume, Avagadroâ€™s, Boltzman constant, temperature.) For an ideal gas consisting of hydrogen atoms at $$1\:\text{atm}\:(1.01\times10^5\:\tfrac{\text{N}}{\text{m}^2})$$ and a temperature of $$300\:\text{K}$$,

**(a)** determine the average volume per hydrogen atom and

**(b)** find the ratio of this volume to the volume of a hydrogen atom.
