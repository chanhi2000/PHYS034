In one of G. Gamow’s Mr. Tompkins tales, the hero visits a “quantum jungle” where $$h$$ is very large. Suppose that you are in such a place where $$h=50\:\text{J}\cdot\text{s}$$. A cheetah runs past you a few meters away.  The cheetah is $$2\:\text{m}$$ long from nose to tail tip and its mass is $$30\:\text{kg}$$.  It is moving at $$40\:\tfrac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$$.  What is the uncertainty in the location of the “midpoint” of the cheetah?  Describe in one sentence how the cheetah would
 look different to you than when $$h$$ has its actual value.

> **NOTE**: George Gamov wrote four absolutely terrific books that explore the natural world in a fun, easy-to-read way. The main character is Mr. Tompkins, a bank clerk. In Mr. Tompkins in Wonderland, Mr. Tompkins he sits in on lectures by a famous physics professor at the nearby university but promptly falls asleep. He has many adventures while dreaming, for example, in one dream he finds himself in this quantum jungle in which $$h=50\:\text{J}\cdot\text{s}$$. In another, he finds himself in a world in which the speed of light is $$10\:\text{mph}$$. For this cheetah problem, assume that the uncertainty in momentum is equal to the momentum.
