It was originally thought that the one of the fundamental forces in nature — the “strong” force — was carried by the pion, with rest mass about $$140\:\tfrac{\text{MeV}}{c^2}$$.  Take its rest energy to be equivalent to the energy uncertainty, and determine how far a virtual pion could travel moving at $$c$$. This is a rough estimate of the range over which the strong force can act.
