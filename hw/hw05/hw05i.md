Rydberg’s equation can be derived using the quantized energy equation in Bohr’s model, as on p. 168 in our book.  Familiarize yourself with this derivation, and then determine a value for the Rydberg constant.  Don’t use $$k$$ and $$e$$ in SI units—instead use $$ke^2=\alpha\hbar{c}$$ as we found in class.
