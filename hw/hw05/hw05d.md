An electron accelerated to $$50\:\text{keV}$$ in an x-ray tube has two successive collisions in being brought to rest in the target, emitting two bremsstrahlung photons in the process. The second photon emitted has a wavelength $$0.095\:\text{nm}$$ longer than the first.

**(a)** What are the wavelengths of the two photons?

**(b)** What was the energy of the electron after emission of the first photon?
