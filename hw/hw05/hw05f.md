Each series of atomic lines for any element has a shortest and a longest wavelength.

**(a)** Use the Rydberg equation to determine the shortest and longest wavelength in the (hydrogen) Balmer series.

**(b)** Determine the lowest and highest energy of photons in the Balmer series.

**(c)** Google the Balmer series and verify your answers to (a) and (b).

**(d)** Use the Rydberg equation to determine the shortest and longest wavelength in the (hydrogen) Pfund series.

**(e)** Determine the lowest and highest energy of photons in the Pfund series.

**(f)** Google the Pfund series and verify your answers to (d) and (e).
