Geiger and Marsden used $$\alpha$$ particles with $$7.7\:\text{MeV}$$ kinetic energy and found that when they were scattered from thin gold foil, the number observed to be scattered at all angles agreed with Rutherfordâ€™s formula. Use this fact to compute an upper limit on the radius of the gold nucleus.
NOTE: Before you start this one, ask yourself whether or not the particle is relativistic.
