Gamma rays emitted by radioactive nuclei also exhibit measurable Compton scattering. Suppose a $$0.511\:\text{MeV}$$ photon from a positron-electron annihilation scatters at $$110^{\circ}$$ from a free electron.
What are the energies of the scattered photon and the recoiling electron?
Relative to the initial direction of the $$0.511\:\text{MeV}$$ photon, what is the direction of the recoiling electronâ€™s velocity vector?

**NOTE**: there are three questions asked.
