The decay constant of $$^{235}\text{U}$$ is $$9.8\times10^{10}\:\text{y}^{-1}$$.

**(a)** Compute the half-life.

**(b)** How many decays occur each second in a $$1.0\:\mu\text{g}$$ sample of $$^{235}\text{U}$$?

**(c)** How many $$^{235}\text{U}$$ atoms will remain in the $$1.0\:\mu\text{g}$$ sample after $$10^6$$ years?
