Consider a parent nucleus $$\text{P}$$ that radioactively emits an alpha particle $$\alpha$$, leaving a daughter nucleus $$\text{D}$$. ($$\text{P}\to{\text{D}}+\alpha$$).  Consider the moment when the daughter and alpha particle are "right next to" each other:

At this moment the Coulomb repulsion is its largest, that is, the Coulomb barrier is highest.  Estimate the height of the Coulomb barrier by considering a nucleus of $$A$$ equal to $$200$$.  Note that we have seen a way to approximate the radius of the nucleus as a function of the atomic number $$A$$. Also, recall the equation you learned in Phys 33 for the Coulomb potential energy. Compare your answer to the value I gave in class for the height of the Coulomb barrier.
